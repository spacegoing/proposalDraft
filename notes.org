    Models containing higher order factors are able to en- code complex
  dependencies between groups of vari- ables, and can encourage
  solutions which match the statistics of the ground truth solution
  (Potetz, 2007; Roth & Black, 2005; Woodford et al., 2009). However,
  the high computational cost of performing MAP infer- ence in such
  models has inhibited their use (Lan et al., 2006). Instead, there has
  been a widespread adoption of the simpler and less powerful
  pairwise-CRF models which allow efficient inference (Szeliski et al.,
  2008).
  While learning the parameters of models with insuffi- cient
  expressivity, researchers can penalize certain mis- representations of
  the solution space using a ‘loss func- tion’ which specifies the
  deviations from ground truth that the learning algorithm should avoid
  (Tsochan- taridis et al., 2005; Taskar et al., 2003). Most previ- ous
  works on these topics have used simple choices of the loss function,
  such as the Hamming loss or squared loss, which lead to tractable
  learning algo- rithms (Szummer et al., 2008). However, in real world
  applications, researchers might prefer more general loss functions
  which penalize deviations in some higher order statistics.
